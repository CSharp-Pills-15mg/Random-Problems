There are rare occasions when we need to generate random numbers. C# offers the `Random` class for generating pseudo-random numbers that can be used anywhere where a random number or random behaviour is needed except for cryptography. Cryptography is another topic for another day. Today let's focus on the `Random` class.

This `Random` class has 

I will not explain in this pill what pseudo-random numbers are and how are they generated by C#. Instead, I want to highlight a problem that we may encounter when using the `Random` class: this class is not thread-safe.

This aspect will raise a couple of questions:

## Questions

- What actually happens when we use a Random instance from multiple threads?
- Can we do something to make it thread-safe?





Let's consider
